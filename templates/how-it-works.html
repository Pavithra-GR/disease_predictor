                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Disease Predictor is a user-friendly app designed to help you identify potential diseases based on your symptoms. We use advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions, along with actionable precaution tips to manage your health.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Project Objectives</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">This mini project was developed as part of a college assignment to apply machine learning concepts in a real-world scenario. Our goal was to build a web application that predicts diseases from user-input symptoms, integrates a Flask backend with a frontend, and provides a seamless user experience with additional features like precaution tips and nearby doctor search.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Technology Behind the App</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The app leverages a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model combined with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to analyze symptoms and predict diseases. This approach allows us to process natural language input effectively, matching your symptoms to a database of known diseases with high accuracy. The backend is powered by Flask, and the frontend is styled with custom CSS for a modern look.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Learning Outcomes</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in machine learning model integration, natural language processing, and full-stack web development. We learned how to preprocess text data, deploy a Flask application, and handle frontend-backend communication. Additionally, we developed skills in debugging complex issues, such as model loading errors and server routing problems, which enhanced our problem-solving abilities.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Acknowledgments</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">We would like to thank our college mentors for their guidance, our peers for their feedback, and online resources like Stack Overflow and documentation for libraries such as Flask and NLTK, which were instrumental in resolving technical challenges. Special thanks to the open-source community for providing the tools and libraries that made this project possible.</p>
